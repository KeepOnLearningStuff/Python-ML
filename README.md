# Project Description & Objectives
The aim of this project is to ensure book readers are comfortable enough with the recommenders so they can have easier time figuring out which book/books they want to read next.
The dataset that was used on this project is a curation of Goodreads books based on real user information.
Using the dataset, main objective is to train a model that predicts a bookâ€™s rating. The project will be represented as a Jupyter Notebook and includes exploratory analysis of the data, feature engineering and selection, model training and evaluation and finally, deployment.
  - Data analysis (data processing, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, plots of relevant attributes) and feature selection (feature engineering, feature pruning, choice
justification).
  - Model training (motivation for selected model, comparison of different models) and evaluation (evaluation metric, results interpretation).

# Prerequisites
  - https://jupyter.org/install
  - https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Jupyter notebooks will be uploaded here for anyone that wishes to improve or try it out on their own.
As for Conda "conda env create -f goodreads-rating.yml" command will create the necessary environment

# Usage 
There will be 4 different approaches to the Project uploaded to this Repositories.
Using different ways to train the model with different predection rates.
